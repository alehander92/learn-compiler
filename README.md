### learn-compiler


Praise God !

learn-compiler is an effort in learning more for compilers and parallel programming

studiying how to implement elements like parsing, type checking, optimizations, code generation,
language service, repl, debug etc

studying how to do it with
  * parallel runs for modules
  * caching
  * modularity

for now a small language, which is maybe a subset of nim is used to target x86_64
